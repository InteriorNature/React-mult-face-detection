# React-mult-face-detection
React App for multiple faces image detection

This is my second React app from the ground up developed for the Udemy class "The Complete Web Developer in 2018: Zero-To-Mastery". We used express.js to build a local server, node 'cors' middleware to enable CORS requests, bcrypt for passwords, postgresql to create and connect 2 databases, knex as the SQL query builder, nodeman as a dev dep to restart the app as we debugged and tested our database/server interactions using Postman, npm, and browser console. We also practiced migrating front-end and back-end to heroku.

To do's:
   1) maybe pull out more front-end code to reduce duplication
   2) do further form-field validations
   3) write server/controllers with another method of state management
   4) actually extract and save faces identified to a database to manipulate with other api's
